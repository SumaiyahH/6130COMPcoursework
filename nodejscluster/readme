The nodejs cluster project contains a dockerfile that creates three identical nodejs containers running the cloud-week1 hello world nodejs code. The file also defines a load balancer that distributes get requests on port 80 to the three node js containers.

to test the service run 

sudo docker-compose up

In a separate terminal test the service using the command 

curl http://127.0.0.1

You should get the "hello world" response.
